# Machine Project 0 - Grading Guidelines

## Grading Process

### Timelines for Grading

* The day after the regular deadline: grading process starts.
* Five days after the hard deadline: TAs finish grading.
* Within one week after the hard deadline: grades posted to Canvas and start collecting regrade requests
* Students can submit regrade requests through the Project Grading Issue Form.
    * The regrade requests are only for TA's mistakes in manual grading.
    * Please do not submit any regrade requests until grades are posted to Canvas.
* One week after the grade release on Canvas: we will stop collecting regrade requests.
* One week after closing regrade requests for projects: TAs will contact you for regrade request results.

### Deduction Decisions

* We will only grade individual portion.
* We will deduct points for hardcoding and not following directions.
* Other bugs may receive written feedback with no deduction.
* We will try to include at least one inline comment about how to improve the code for each studentâ€™s submission, even for the ones with a perfect score.
